Features
--------

*   User registration and authentication with role-based access control using Passport.js
*   CRUD operations for user management (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
*   Secure password hashing with bcrypt
*   Support for user roles (e.g., Admin, Manager)
*   Profile picture integration with external URLs
*   MongoDB integration for persistent data storage

Technologies
------------

*   **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for backend development
*   **Express.js**: Web framework for building RESTful APIs
*   **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data
*   **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB to manage schema and queries
*   **Passport.js**: Authentication middleware for secure login and role-based access
*   **Bcrypt**: For secure password hashing
*   **dotenv**: For environment variable management

Installation
------------

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    
        git clone https://github.com/nashnc/machinetest-ateam.git
        cd machinetest-ateam
        
    
2.  Install dependencies:
    
        npm install
    
3.  Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:
    
        PORT=3000
        MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/machinetest-ateam
        SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret_key
        
    
    Replace MONGODB\_URI and SESSION\_SECRET with your MongoDB connection string and a secret key for Passport.js sessions, respectively.
4.  Start MongoDB: Ensure MongoDB is running locally or provide a cloud-based MongoDB URI.
5.  Run the application:
    
        npm start
    
    The server will start on http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in .env).

Usage
-----

*   Development: Use `npm run dev` (if configured with nodemon) for live reloading during development.
*   API Testing: Use tools like Postman or cURL to interact with the API endpoints.
*   Sample Data: The role\_auth\_crud.users.json file provides example user data, including:
    *   Admin user (super.admin@ateam.com, role: Admin)
    *   Manager users (e.g., john.doe@workemail.com, role: Manager) Import this file into your MongoDB collection (users) to seed initial data:
        
            mongoimport --db machinetest-ateam --collection users --file role_auth_crud.users.json --jsonArray
